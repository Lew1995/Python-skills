## Different projects for Python
### Project 1

In this project, I used Python to practice trying to use a dataset to be able to use the data and to be able to find the data that I needed. This meant that I was using different methods such as slicing as well as uploading the dataset from the google drive to be able to use the dataset and manipulate the data so that I can successfully practice with it.

This came with a few issues because since I had used input further up in my code it then clashed when I used input again further down which meant that I was getting an error, even if I changed the input code to something else which was count I then needed to reset the code so that it would work. This experience provided me with an opportunity to be able to see what happens when the code that you use can clash in an unexpected way and the best way to solve this problem.

### Project 2

In this project I wanted to try and create a new coloumn in the dataset that I was using which was a dataset provided to me by Just IT which showed the different students and the grades that they have obtained throughout the year. I also wanted to add a a second column next to that which showed a true and false statement to tell me whether the student had passed or failed based on the score that got in this specific grade.

This allowed me to try and add new information into the dataset and to be able to have an outcome happen that I wanted, it also gave me the ability to learn new code that was a little more complicated that I had been practicing with so that I could test myself and to resolve any issues that I may have come across such as error messages.
