## Different projects for Python
### Project 1

In this project, I used python to practice trying to use a dataset to be able to use the data and to be able to find the data that I needed. This meant that I was using different methods such as slicing as well as uploading the dataset from the google drive to be able to use the dataset and manipulate the data so that I can successfully practice with it.
